<h1>How do I make my old Project Porcupine repository link to the new one?</h1>
<p>If you have an old Project Porcupine repository fork and you want to contribute to the new one it is quite easy, if you want to keep the old repository fork then follow these instructions. If you don't then just delete your old fork and then do these steps, instead of having two forks with the new one called <code>ProjectPorcupine-1</code> you'll just have one with it being called <code><a class="el" href="namespace_project_porcupine.html">ProjectPorcupine</a></code>, so remove all instances of <code>-1</code> in the below set of instructions.</p><ol type="1">
<li>First you have to fork the new <code>OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine</code> project.</li>
<li>You will now have two forks one called <code><a class="el" href="namespace_project_porcupine.html">ProjectPorcupine</a></code> and the other <code>ProjectPorcupine-1</code>.</li>
<li>Copy the link to the git of the <code>ProjectPorcupine-1</code> (https) it should be in format <code><a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>&lt;USERNAME&gt;/ProjectPorcupine-1.git</code>.</li>
<li>Open up gitbash or commandline and type <code>git remote remove origin</code>. This will remove your origin remote that originally was linked to the old repository, if your's is called something different for some reason remove that one.</li>
<li>Also remove the old upstream using <code>git remote remove upstream</code>.</li>
<li>Link to the new upstream by typing <code>git remote add upstream <a href="https://github.com/OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine.git">https://github.com/OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine.git</a></code></li>
<li>Add the link to your new origin by typing <code>git remote add origin <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>&lt;USERNAME&gt;/ProjectPorcupine-1.git</code> (using that link you just copied before).</li>
<li>And tada your done, you can checkout any feature branches you were working on and push them to your new fork location since you'll still have the local copies and it doesn't require any new setup just changing of remotes. Isn't this easy!</li>
</ol>
<h1>Note</h1>
<p>Please also read the [Contributor's Portal](../../wiki/Contributors'-Portal#important-links), mainly the <a href="../../wiki/Contributing-Guidelines">Contributing Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>If you would like to contribute to this project by modifying/adding to the program code or various creative assets, read the <a href="#best-practices-for-contributing">Best Practices for Contributing</a> below and feel free to follow the standard Github workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fork the project.</li>
<li>Clone your fork to your computer.<ul>
<li>From the command line: <code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>&lt;USERNAME&gt;/ProjectPorcupine.git</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change into your new project folder.<ul>
<li>From the command line: <code>cd <a class="el" href="namespace_project_porcupine.html">ProjectPorcupine</a></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[optional] Add the upstream repository to your list of remotes.<ul>
<li>From the command line: <code>git remote add upstream <a href="https://github.com/OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine.git">https://github.com/OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine.git</a></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a branch for your new feature.<ul>
<li>From the command line: <code>git checkout -b my-feature-branch-name</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make your changes.<ul>
<li>Avoid making changes to more files than necessary for your feature (i.e. refrain from combining your "real" pull request with incidental bug fixes). This will simplify the merging process and make your changes clearer.</li>
<li>Very much avoid making changes to the Unity-specific files, like the scene and the project settings unless absolutely necessary. Changes here are very likely to cause difficult to merge conflicts. Work in code as much as possible. (We will be trying to change the UI to be more code-driven in the future.) Making changes to prefabs should generally be safe &ndash; but create a copy of the main scene and work there instead (then delete your copy of the scene before committing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commit your changes. From the command line:<ul>
<li><code>git add Assets/my-changed-file.cs</code></li>
<li><code>git add Assets/my-other-changed-file.cs</code></li>
<li><code>git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While you were working some other pull request might have gone in the breaks your stuff or vice versa. This can be a <em>merge conflict</em> but also conflicting game logic or code. Before you test, merge with master.<ul>
<li><code>git fetch upstream</code></li>
<li><code>git merge upstream/master</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test. Start the game and do something related to your feature/fix.</li>
<li>Push the branch, uploading it to Github.<ul>
<li><code>git push origin my-feature-branch-name</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a "Pull Request" from your branch here on Github.<ul>
<li>Include screenshots demonstrating your change if applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a video tutorial, please see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2fl17eEpwI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2fl17eEpwI</a></li>
</ol>
<h1>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h1>
<p>Depending on the order that Pull Requests get processed, your PR may result in a conflict and become un-mergable. To correct this, do the following from the command line:</p>
<p>Switch to your branch: <code>git checkout my-feature-branch-name</code> Pull in the latest upstream changes: <code>git pull upstream master</code> Find out what files have a conflict: <code>git status</code></p>
<p>Edit the conflicting file(s) and look for a block that looks like this: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</div><div class="line">my awesome change</div><div class="line">=======</div><div class="line">some other person&#39;s less awesome change</div><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some-branch</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Replace all five (or more) lines with the correct version (yours, theirs, or a combination of the two). ONLY the correct content should remain (none of that <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> stuff.)</p>
<p>Then re-commit and re-push the file.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">git add the-changed-file.cs</div><div class="line">git commit -m &quot;Resolved conflict between this and PR #123&quot;</div><div class="line">git push origin my-feature-branch-name</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The pull request should automatically update to reflect your changes.</p>
<h1>Unity Version</h1>
<p>We are using Unity version 5.6.2. All pull requests must build in 5.6.2 to be a valid patch. Though you can use <code>#IF UNITY_X_Y_Z</code> with x, y, z referring to the version details such as 5.4.2 or 5.6.1, More details <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html">here</a></p>

<h2>Kaplan Board? (Projects)</h2>
<p>You can find it <a href="https://github.com/OrderOfThePorcupine/ProjectPorcupine/projects/1">here</a>. Due to weird restrictions that github puts on projects only gate keepers can update them (personally I'm all for a system that is request based so we just have to approve changes but doubt github would ever implement that). Regardless me and Koosemose will update it (along with any other gatekeepers) as time goes on, whenever you open a PR I will move the note into the <code>In Progress</code> column, you can also  me on either the PR or on Discord, I'm somewhat regular in checking emails and github, and try to give me/koosemose atleast 12 hrs cause of sleep and other commitments before pinging us to death.</p>
<h2>Style Guidelines</h2>
<p>We have standardized on Microsoft's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx">C# Coding Conventions</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229045(v=vs.110).aspx">General Naming Conventions</a>, with the following exception:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using 'var', even when the type would be clear from context. Verbose typing is best typing.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a TL;DR on our coding practices, adhere to the following example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{c#}</div><div class="line">// All files begin with the following license header (remove this line):</div><div class="line">#region License</div><div class="line">// ====================================================</div><div class="line">// Project Porcupine Copyright(C) 2016 Team Porcupine</div><div class="line">// This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; This is free software,</div><div class="line">// and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; See</div><div class="line">// file LICENSE, which is part of this source code package, for details.</div><div class="line">// ====================================================</div><div class="line">#endregion</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">using System; // System usings go first</div><div class="line">using UnityEngine; // followed by any other using directives</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">// Use camelCasing unless stated otherwise.</div><div class="line">// Descriptive names for variables/methods should be used.</div><div class="line">// Fields, properties and methods should always specify their scope, aka private/protected/internal/public.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">// Interfaces start with an I and should use PascalCasing.</div><div class="line">public interface IInterfaceable</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">}</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">// Class names should use PascalCasing.</div><div class="line">// Braces are on a new line. ;)</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">///</div><div class="line">public class Class</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    // Private fields should be camelCased.</div><div class="line">    // Use properties for any field that needs access levels other than private</div><div class="line">    private string someField;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    // Events should use PascalCasing as well.</div><div class="line">    // ✓ DO name events with a verb or a verb phrase.</div><div class="line">    // Examples include Clicked, Painting, DroppedDown, and so on.</div><div class="line">    // ✓ DO give events names with a concept of before and after, using the present and past tenses.</div><div class="line">    // For example, a close event that is raised before a window is closed would be called Closing,</div><div class="line">    // and one that is raised after the window is closed would be called Closed.</div><div class="line">    public event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; SomeEvent;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    // Properties should use PascalCasing.</div><div class="line">    public int MemberProperty { get; set; }</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    // Methods should use PascalCasing.</div><div class="line">    // Method parameters should be camelCased.</div><div class="line">    public void SomeMethod(int functionParameter)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">        // Local variables should also be camelCased.</div><div class="line">        int myLocalVariable = 0;</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we are standardizing on what should be Microsoft Visual Studio's default code formatting rules. If you are using MonoDevelop (as many of us are), please go to your preferences and set the C# source code formatting rules to the MVS setting:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/777633/17719999/920fb534-63ec-11e6-8903-3725f2cd05b0.png" alt="screen shot 2016-08-16 at 8 03 22 pm"/>

</div>
<p>It is also highly recommended that you install <a href="https://github.com/TeamPorcupine/ProjectPorcupine/wiki/StyleCop">StyleCop</a>, which will automatically point out any deviations from the project's style guidelines. Any deviations in your code which can be tracked by StyleCop will result in the rejection of your Pull Request.</p>
<h2>Adding New Types of <a class="el" href="class_furniture.html" title="InstalledObjects are things like walls, doors, and furniture (e.g. a sofa). ">Furniture</a>, <a class="el" href="class_inventory.html">Inventory</a>, Commands...</h2>
<p>There are multiple examples and it should be reasonably easy to add new types, when building a PR of just these you don't need to open an issue though it is encouraged for balancing purposes. Any new types should be fully implemented in PR and shouldn't just be placeholders.</p>
<h3>Furniture/Inventory</h3>
<p>We have standardized the Types of <a class="el" href="class_furniture.html" title="InstalledObjects are things like walls, doors, and furniture (e.g. a sofa). ">Furniture</a> and <a class="el" href="class_inventory.html">Inventory</a> to match <code>type_material</code>, such as <code>wall_steel</code> and <code>generator_oxygen</code> or <code>generator_power</code>, for localization a matching prefix is added automatically to Type such as <code>inv</code> and <code>furn</code>. This means a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>When adding a new <a class="el" href="class_furniture.html" title="InstalledObjects are things like walls, doors, and furniture (e.g. a sofa). ">Furniture</a> or inventory the files should have the Type "type_material", you could give it the more english sounding name, as of now name is not used for anything.</li>
<li>For machines the convention will be <code>whatItDoes_whatItMakes</code>.</li>
<li>For multiword parts it will be <code>myType_myMaterial</code>.</li>
<li>In the Localization a line could be will be <code>inv_type_material=Material Type</code> and <code>furn_type_material=Material Type</code>.</li>
<li>In Localization the description can be set with <code>inv_type_material_desc=Some cool description.</code> and <code>furn_type_material_desc=Some awesome description</code>.</li>
<li>For image files and their xml files use the Type as the name.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for Contributing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before you start coding, open an issue so that the community can discuss your change to ensure it is in line with the goals of the project and not being worked on by someone else. This allows for discussion and fine tuning of your feature and results in a more succent and focused additions.<ul>
<li>If you are fixing a small glitch or bug, you may make a PR without opening an issue.</li>
<li>If you are adding a large feature, create an issue prefixed with "[Discussion]" and be sure to take community feedback and get general approval before making your change and submitting a PR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Pull Requests represent final code. Please ensure they are:</p><ul>
<li>Well tested by the author. It is the author's job to ensure their code works as expected.</li>
<li>Be free of unnecessary log calls. Logging is great for debugging, but when a PR is made, log calls should only be present when there is an actual error or to warn of an unimplemented feature. Please use <code>UnityDebugger.Debugger</code> instead of Unity's <code>Debug.Log()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">If your code is untested, log heavy, or incomplete, prefix your PR with "[WIP]", so others know it is still being tested and shouldn't be considered for merging yet.</p>
</li>
<li>Small changes are preferable over large ones. The larger a change is the more likely it is to conflict with the project and thus be denied. If your addition is large, be sure to extensively discuss it in an "issue" before you submit a PR, or even start coding.</li>
<li>Changes to code that your PR isn't specifically fixing, try to keep your PR focused cause people may have problems with a small section of your PR but the rest is ready to be merged which complicates the merging procedure.</li>
<li>Limit any change to code definitions (variables, functions, properties, and classes/structs/interfaces)<ul>
<li>A restructure/overhaul is defined as the focus being on the entire system rather than a small module so almost every one of these 'cautions' are void in that case.</li>
<li>Any changes to functions should be limited, you should try to work 'within' the current project. Any system 'restructures' or overhauls are obviously a different matter. This is because if you have to manipulate and twist functions to achieve certain functionality you are most likely applying a hack, or the system is very limited in scope and in that case it is most likely a restructure or overhaul that you are doing.</li>
<li>Adding new public variables should always be a cautionary procedure, so unless you are specifically exposing private variables for modding purposes or removing public variables since they aren't needed, you should take care with adding a bunch of public variables. Exceptions being new systems entirely or system restructures.</li>
<li>Shouldn't remove any classes/interfaces/structs unless your PR is a restructure/overhaul.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Document your changes in your PR. If you add a feature that you expect others to use, explain exactly how future code should interact with your additions.</li>
<li>Avoid making changes to more files than necessary for your feature (i.e. refrain from combining your "real" pull request with incidental bug fixes). This will simplify the merging process and make your changes clearer.</li>
<li>Avoid making changes to the Unity-specific files, like the scene and the project settings unless absolutely necessary. Changes here are very likely to cause difficult merge conflicts. Work in code as much as possible. (We will be trying to change the UI to be more code-driven in the future.) Making changes to prefabs should generally be safe &ndash; but create a copy of the main scene and work there instead (then delete your copy of the scene before committing).</li>
<li>Include screenshots demonstrating your change if applicable. All UI changes should include screenshots.</li>
<li>If you want to help with localization of the project you can submit your work over at <a href="https://github.com/QuiZr/ProjectPorcupineLocalization/tree/Someone_will_come_up_with_a_proper_naming_scheme_later">Localization Repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Following these guidelines will ensure that your additions are approved quickly and integrated into the project. Thanks for your contribution!</p>
<h2>File Formats</h2>
<p>In the primary GIT repo, we will only accept files in these formats:</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Images should be in a compressed, ready-to share format like PNG or JPEG. The original Photoshop/GIMP/etc... files are not to be commited to the repository. However, hosting the originals somewhere (like a public Google Drive folder) as a reference would be appreciated (but not required).</p>
<h3>Sound Files &amp; Music</h3>
<p>As per Issue #795, we have standardized on the open-source friendly OGG audio format, as opposed to MP3 or uncompressed WAV files. Small sound effects that are played frequently should likely be set to "Decompress on Load" in Unity's inspector, whereas longer sounds (such as songs) should not be. Hosting the original, uncompressed WAV files somewhere (like a public Google Drive folder) as a reference would be appreciated (but not required). </p>
